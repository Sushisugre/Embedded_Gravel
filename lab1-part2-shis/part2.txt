strTable.s:

1. Replace 
    mov    r2, #0
    cmp    r2, r3
    ble .L11
   with 
    cmp r3, #0
    ble .L11
   to remove unnecessary middle step

1. Replace count-up loop with count-down loop
    mov r2, #0  @ r2 is the index
    ...
    add r2, r2, #1  @ r2++
    cmp r2, r0   @ while r2 < dl
    blt .L9
    change to:

1. Combine mode operation, to avoid code duplication 
Changed from:
    sub ip, r3, #23    @ip = r3 - 23
    cmp ip, #22
    ble .L13
.L7:    @ ip % 23
    sub ip, ip, #23
    cmp ip, #22
    bgt .L7
To:
    mov ip, r3
.L7:
    sub ip, ip, #23
    cmp ip, #22
    bgt .L7

2. Avoid load same character from memory twice
Changed from:
    ldrb    r3, [r5, ip]    @ zero_extendqisi2
    ldrb    r6, [r1, r2]    @ zero_extendqisi2
    cmp r3, r6
    strneb  r6, [r5, ip]
To:
    ldrb    r6, [r5, ip]    @ zero_extendqisi2
    cmp r3, r6
    strneb  r3, [r5, ip]

3. Store the character from dst directly without checking the character in str,
the time it saved from occastionally same char case is much less than the overhead of 
load and compare each time
Changed from:
    ldrb    r6, [r5, ip]    @ zero_extendqisi2
    cmp r3, r6
    strneb  r3, [r5, ip]
To:
    strneb  r3, [r5, ip]
